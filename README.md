The Android Way
===============

What if you had this magical Android Java Application Development and Design book that got you into the philosophy of Android Application Development and Design while at the same time taught all those android best practices that seem to be hidden behind each fortune 500 corporation wall?

Once upon a time the computer language called java was new and thus there were no java programmers except for those at the firm that created Java. Thus, its not really true that non computer science people cannot learn java or Android Java Application Development.

The next area of business start expansion will be that one-to-two person business that creates an Android Application that takes some free data that our society produces and transforms it into something that is magically integrated with an activity. That could be you controlling your own destiny and the destiny of your family. Not working for the MAN or the WOMEN and not the GOVERNMENT, but you charting the course of your own destiny.

This book content and code is designed to give you that beginning map towards that adventure.
