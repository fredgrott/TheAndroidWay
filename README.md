The Android Way
===============

This is some coding projects and content for a book titled The Android Way which
Apache Licensed 2.0.

I do not know if its a book that will have many authors or just me as the author. But, the format is in
gitbook using the same toolchain so that anyone can download the book and generate a
copy in the format they want.

That being said the focus of the book is to give all the under-employed that are feeling the disruptive
march of technological progress a way to get the knowledge and skill to get that one Android Application
out there in Google Play or Amazon App Store, etc that will assist them in paying for a used car,
the health insurance  co-pay, etc that gives them and their family a better life and hopefully at some
point a piece of the American Dream rather than depend upon the failed promises of US Congress.

With this being targeted to non-programmers and non-designers that does not mean that no code and no design
within this book. It simply means I am going to show you the fast way to get those areas so that you
can than get to coding your Android Application. It does however mean that I will be talking about non
coding subjects.
