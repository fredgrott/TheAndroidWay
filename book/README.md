# Introduction

We stand on a precipice between the industrial revolution that our parents somewhat trusted and the new and scary virtual information services revolution.  It is no longer the role of Universities, Colleges, Libraries, and other institutions to hold back the upcoming tide of you and me creating these new applications that use these virtual services create opportunities for ourselves to get a piece of the American Dream.

For the second time we can use our under-valued time to grab some destiny for ourselves and our families.
