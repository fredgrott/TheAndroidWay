## Human Languages vs JavaComputer Language

In Human Languages we organize around components of sentences such as nouns and verbs where those objects
are equal players in the game. However, that is not true in computer languages.

In the Java Computer Language each object is a class and each class brings with it its own implied
group of sentences that use some verbs defined in its own class. Its about like defining some dictionaries
about specific task and environments and defining those dictionaries flexible enough that those dictionaries
than can be expanded to added related task and environments.

You might have found scripting computer languages easier as those have methods(verbs) on the same level as nouns(classes).
