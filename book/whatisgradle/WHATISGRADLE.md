# What Is Gradle

The current build system used in Android Java Application Development is called Gradle and has as its base the computer language called groovy. Its a Domain Specific Language in that it was written in Groovy to solve a particular set of problems and tasks that are in the build problem area.

Groovy has both nouns(classes) and verbs(methods) on somewhat the same level and so you are not entirely forced to carry this heavy set of Encyclopedia of Briticana along each time you create something. And Gradle is not like the previous build system called Ant which used the inflexible XML declaration system.
